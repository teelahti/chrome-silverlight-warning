# Proof of concept warning page for Chrome users only #

As Chrome is about to drop Silverlight support completely, some users will see blank pages or errors for old Silverlight legacy apps. This is very fast proof of concept for a landing page that would be shown to Chrome users only. This page is transparently skipped if user selects "Never show me this message again".
